TypeScript support is built in to Noderize.

[See example](https://github.com/Cretezy/noderize/tree/master/packages/examples/basic-typescript).

## Entry

To allow your entry file (normally `src/index.js`) to be a TypeScript file, simply change the `noderize.entry` field in your `package.json`:

```json
"noderize": {
    "entry": "src/index.ts"
}
```
